# Customer-Personality-Dataset-Cleaning
# Data Cleaning Task

## Objective
The objective of this task was to clean a raw dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, fixing inconsistent formats, and correcting data types.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas

## Summary of Steps
- Identified and handled missing values in the `Income` column using the median.
- Removed duplicate rows.
- Standardized text data (e.g., cleaned up values in `Marital_Status`).
- Converted the `Dt_Customer` column to proper datetime format.
- Renamed column headers to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores.
- Ensured all columns have appropriate data types.

The cleaned dataset is now ready for further analysis or modeling.
